# KeyHollow Work Status

Updated: 2026-09-05
Branch: `feature/general-file-support`
Pull request: Draft PR #33

## Current task

Refine the explicit file-import review flow so a successful primary-vault import clears its pending state and returns to the unified vault instead of appearing to remain in staging.

## Completed work

- General File Support remains an independently compiled add-on behind narrow interfaces.
- Selecting files creates pending review candidates and does not change the vault manifest.
- The review screen provides an explicit `Import N Files into Vault` confirmation.
- Removing or cancelling pending candidates leaves the vault and source files unchanged.
- Security-scoped file access is owned and released by the add-on rather than the UI.
- Build 23 physical-device testing confirmed that a selected PDF is encrypted and persisted in the add-on store.
- Physical-device evidence isolated the remaining defect to presentation: the primary Vault screen read only the photo manifest and incorrectly reported `Empty Vault` when encrypted general files existed.
- Implemented a unified primary Vault presentation that composes authenticated photo and general-file records without merging their stores or manifests.
- A general-file-only vault now displays its encrypted files on the primary screen.
- Tapping a primary-screen file opens the dedicated Vault Files manager, and dismissing that manager refreshes the primary file list after imports or deletions.
- Moved shared general-file presentation and scoped-access composition into one UI-layer file, removing duplicate type-icon and cryptographic adapter code.
- Added a regression assertion covering photo-only, file-only, mixed, and truly empty primary-vault states.
- PR #33 completed the corrected macOS simulator build, full regression/security suite, architecture enforcement, release-hygiene gate, and Swift CodeQL analysis at `84262d0`.
- Frank confirmed on a physical iPhone that Build 24 fixes the functional defect: general files persist and are reachable from the primary Vault screen.
- Build 24 exposed a presentation-quality issue only: general files use an oversized list card while photos use compact square tiles.
- Replaced the oversized primary-screen file panel with compact file tiles inside the same three-column grid used by photo thumbnails.
- File tiles retain file-type identity, display name, size, accessibility labels, and navigation into the dedicated file manager.
- Photo-selection mode visibly disables file tiles because its save/delete actions remain intentionally photo-specific.
- Updated the add-on behavior record to document the unified mixed-content grid without weakening the separate manifests or compiled-module boundary.
- PR #33 completed the refined macOS simulator build, full regression/security suite, architecture enforcement, release-hygiene gate, and Swift CodeQL analysis at `7b41ffc`.
- Build 25 physical-device testing confirmed that the unified mixed-content grid works and files remain encrypted, persisted, and reachable.
- The pending import candidates already clear after confirmation, but the same `Vault Files` sheet immediately switches to its persisted-record manager, making the imported file appear to remain in staging.

## Test and build status

- Corrected source architecture boundary check: passed locally.
- Corrected source release-hygiene check: passed locally.
- Corrected source whitespace/diff validation: passed locally.
- Previous remote simulator build, full tests, and Swift CodeQL passed at `6b39328`.
- Build 23 general-file encryption and persistence on a physical iPhone: passed for a PDF.
- Build 23 primary-vault visibility with a general-file-only vault: failed; correction is now published for review.
- Build 24 primary-vault general-file visibility and navigation: passed on a physical iPhone.
- Build 24 mixed-content visual consistency: refinement required before merge.
- Refined source architecture boundary check: passed locally.
- Refined source release-hygiene check: passed locally.
- Refined source whitespace/diff validation: passed locally.
- Refined macOS simulator build and full regression/security suite: passed on PR #33 at `7b41ffc`.
- Refined Swift CodeQL security analysis: passed on PR #33 at `7b41ffc`.
- Build 25 unified mixed-content grid and file persistence: passed on a physical iPhone.
- Build 25 post-import flow clarity: failed; the completed import remains in the file-manager sheet and looks like uncleared staging.
- Corrected macOS simulator build and full regression/security suite: passed on PR #33 at `84262d0`.
- Corrected Swift CodeQL security analysis: passed on PR #33 at `84262d0`.
- Production and App Store review: untouched.

## Blockers

- No implementation blocker. The post-import transition needs a narrow UI correction, automated validation, and another internal device check.

## Next action

Implement a tested completion transition that dismisses a successful primary-vault import after its confirmation message, while preserving the persistent `Vault Files` manager when users intentionally open it. Then run the complete PR gates before another delivery build.

## Frank's decision required

- After the corrected build reaches TestFlight, Frank must confirm that a successful primary-vault import returns to the unified grid and that intentionally opening `Vault Files` still shows the stored file.
- Final merge and any App Store review submission remain separate decisions requiring Frank's explicit approval after device validation.
